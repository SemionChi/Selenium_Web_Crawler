# nadlan_crawler

A web crawler i made in order to have an as accurate as possible real estate data about a particular city.
There is no available credible real-estate API so crawling a web form was required.

# Functions:
  Opening nadlan site, filling the required fields by the properties room amount
  scroll down until no more real-estate deals available 
  start collecting data set by set 
  further collecting history deals info if available
  
# After running for two days:
  total raw metadata rows: 38,842
